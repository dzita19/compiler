declarations:
  if there is an error in a declaration, the declared identifier shall not be added to symtab.
  every reference of identifier that is not declared correctly shall be reported as if identifier is not found in symtab.
  tags will be added to symtab, but invalid fields won't be added
  therefore, tag can have alignment and size 0

initializer:
  if there is an error in initializer, all future initializers until the end of declarator are dismissed.
  error is handled in full initializer (or in declaration).
  however, tree stack must be cleared so it doesn't disrupt tree building

expressions:
  if there is an error in any subexpression, its exprnode shall be 0.
  every expression has to check validity of its subexpressions.

statements:
  even if there is an error in any part of statement, that statement shall be added to tree.
  it is not important whether or not the statement will be added to the tree because code will not be generated.



UNFINISHED TASKS:
  const address expression is not finished - addition and subtraction are not done
  declaration cleanup
  initializer cleanup
  initialize array length
